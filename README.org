Emacs frontend for weather web services[fn:1].

* Usage
Set your default cities list for completion:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq wttrin-default-cities '("Paris" "New York" "Rio de Janeiro"
                                "Nairobi" "Tokyo" "Delhi" "Canberra"))
#+end_src

You can also specify the language you wish to use:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq wttrin-language "fr-FR")
#+end_src

The debate over whether the metric or the imperial units are better is
long and ultimately depends on which you grew up with (spoiler, metric
is better and is used by default). Well, there is a setting for that:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq wttrin-use-metric nil) ; For fellow US Emacs users
#+end_src

You can now run ~M-x wttrin~ to get the upcoming weather for your
city. When the weather is displayed you can press ~q~ to quit the buffer
or ~g~ to query the weather for another city.

* Installation
** Local installation
If you want to install this package the old-fashioned way, clone this
repository in Emacs’ ~load-path~ and add the following to your ~.emacs~ or
~init.el~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'wttrin)
#+end_src

** Straight + use-package
My personnal choice in terms of installing packages, add the following
to your ~.emacs~ or ~init.el~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package wttrin
    :defer t
    :ensure t
    :straight (wttrin :type git
                      :host github
                      :repo "Phundrak/emacs-wttrin")
    :config
    (setq wttrin-default-cities '("Paris" "Lyon")
          wttrin-use-metric t))
#+end_src

** Other methods
I am aware other methods are available for installing packages in
Emacs, such as ~quelpa~ or Spacemacs’ and DoomEmacs’ package managers,
however I am yet unsure how to install this package with them. If you
do, feel free to submit a PR with new instructions!
